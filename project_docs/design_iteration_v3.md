# Design Iteration: Mobile-Optimized Item Card

To address the "messy" single-row layout, I've redesigned the item input as a structured card. This uses vertical space more effectively on mobile devices.

## Mobile Item Card Layout
Instead of squeezing everything into one row, we split it:
*   **Row 1**: **Item Name** (Primary focus) + **Delete** button.
*   **Row 2**: **Price**, **Min Qty**, and **Max Qty** distributed evenly.

This ensures touch targets are large enough and the data is easy to scan.

## Next Steps
If this card layout works for you, I will incorporate it into the full Single Column design and proceed to the **Implementation Plan**.
