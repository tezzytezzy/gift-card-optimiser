# Design Iteration: Single Column v3

I've updated the wireframe to include your specific requests.

## Changes
1.  **Items Section**:
    *   Added a **Delete (Trash)** button to each item card.
    *   Added a prominent **+ Add Item** button below the list.
    *   Added a primary **Show me deals** button at the bottom of the section to trigger the calculation.
2.  **Results Section**:
    *   Now features specific summary cards for **Best Cash Topup** and **Best Card Loss** as requested.

## Next Steps
If this design meets your requirements, I will proceed to create the **Implementation Plan** and start building.
